          "In the local betel leaf sales market used traditional selling unit is based on unique local terms such as: 1 Quad = 4 pieces, 1 Choli = 8 or 9 Quads (32 or 36 pieces), 1 Pair Choli = 2 Choli (8 or 9 Quad), 1 Quri = 64 Pairs of 9-Quad Choli (4608 pieces) Or, 1 Quri = 72 Pairs of 8-Quad Choli (4608 pieces). In the market, sellers arrive with one or more bundles of betel leaves. Each bundle contains a certain number of pair cholisâ€”categorized as either 8-quad or 9-quad. The price of a bundle is calculated based on the rate per quri. For instance, if the quri price is 5000à§³ and a bundle includes 90 pair cholis of the 9-quad type, the raw price is calculated as: (90 Ã— 5000) Ã· 64 = 7031.25à§³. If the choli type is 8-quad, the formula becomes: (90 Ã— 5000) Ã· 72 = 6250à§³. This raw amount is charged to the buyer and forms part of the buyerâ€™s invoice. From this raw amount, the market organizer's commission is deductedâ€”typically 10%. For example, 7031.25 Ã— 10% = 703.13à§³ as commission. The sellerâ€™s final payout then becomes: 7031.25 - 703.13 = 6328.13à§³. Since a single seller may have multiple bundles, and the market involves numerous sellers, performing these calculations and works manually with a regular calculator is tedious, error-prone, and mentally exhausting for accountants.",

        solution:
          "To solve these challenges, I built a simple web app that automates pricing, commission, and payouts. By entering the bundle quantity, quri price, choli type, and buyer and seller names, the app instantly calculates totals and deducts the market organizerâ€™s commission. It supports multiple sellers and bundles, reducing errors and saving time in daily market operations.",
